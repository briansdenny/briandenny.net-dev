## Overview

This page demonstrates how a small program transforms structured inputs (birth **date**, **time**, **location**) into structured outputs (a computed **Sun sign**). I chose astrology because it’s a complex, rules-based domain with precise inputs — ideal for practicing algorithms, date/time handling, and modular design. The emphasis here is on **engineering**, not belief.

## Technical Focus

- **Input handling:** HTML5 date/time inputs, basic validation, safe string handling, and progressive enhancement without external libraries.
- **Deterministic rules:** A pure function maps calendar month/day to a Sun sign using explicit boundaries (Aries → Pisces). This shows “inputs → branching → outputs.”
- **Separation of concerns:** UI (shortcode) and logic (JS module in `assets/js/astro-mvp.js`) are decoupled. Styling is scoped (`assets/css/astro-mvp.css`) to avoid theme collisions.
- **Extensibility path:** The date-range method can later be swapped for an ephemeris-backed calculation (Swiss Ephemeris, NASA JPL), and additional modules (Ascendant, Moon, houses, aspects) can plug in without rewriting the UI.

## What I Learned

- **Time & location UX:** Even simple forms benefit from clear constraints (e.g., ISO date/time) and helpful messages when precision matters (cusp proximity).
- **Modular thinking:** Keeping pure functions separate from DOM code made it easy to test and reason about.
- **Communicating limits:** Documenting assumptions (fixed boundaries; no time-zone ingress) is key to trust when outputs are interpretive.

## Try the mini-demo

Enter a birth date, time, and location below to see a neutral, computed fact (Sun sign) and a brief explanation generated by the program.

## Next Steps

- Swap date-ranges for an ephemeris (higher precision near boundaries).
- Add a location → timezone resolver to improve sub-day accuracy.
- Extend outputs with one or two additional placements (e.g., Moon) via independent modules.

## Notes

This MVP intentionally keeps the “astrology” surface area small. The focus is the **software design**: clean inputs, explicit rules, clear outputs, and a path to scale.
