    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello! I'm a writer and editor with an extensive background in research methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) and adult teaching/coaching. I get most excited when I'm making measurable impacts through my research, my writing, or my personal connections! I'm naturally inquisitive, so I enjoy learning and am always eager to take on new challenges. My extensive experience and formal training in research, education, and teaching has refined my ability to ask the right questions, systematically analyze problems, identify creative solutions, report on my findings, and teach others how to do the same.
